# Battleship Game

A simple implementation of the classic Battleship game in Python. Players take turns guessing the locations of each other's ships on a grid, with the goal of sinking all opponent's ships before their own are sunk.

## Project Structure

- `main.py`: The main entry point of the game, which handles game flow, player turns, and game setup.
- `board.py`: Contains functions to create and print the game board.
- `ship.py`: Contains functions for placing ships on the board, making guesses, and checking if all ships have been sunk.
- `shipconfig.py`: Manages ship configurations and selections.
